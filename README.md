# Projekt Sara
## Basic info
Project Sára is a Czech voice assistant for computers. The assistant allows, in addition to the already programmed commands, to enter your own commands.
## How to run
First, you need to install the modules that you can find in the requirements.txt document. There may be a problem installing the pyaudio module. In this case, the pyaudio module can be installed using **pipwin**, or you can install it directly via [this page](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio). Then just run main.py. Enjoy the program :)
## Program control
Control of the program is described in detail in the document (So far only in Czech) [Projekt Sára - Ovládání.pdf](https://github.com/Enigma036/Projekt-Sara/blob/main/Projekt%20S%C3%A1ra%20-%20Ovl%C3%A1d%C3%A1n%C3%AD.pdf).
